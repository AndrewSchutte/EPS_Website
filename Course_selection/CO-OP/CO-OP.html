	<h2>summary</h2>
	<p>Elgin’s Co-op Program is a cohort of students that 
includes set academic courses, two work experiences 
(without missing instructional time), customer service 
training, completion of Career Life Connections 12 and a 
variety of field trips related to curriculum and careers. 
Instead of the standard 16 credit semester, co-op 
students receive 20 credits. The application process 
begins in grade 10 and is based on academic 
performance, attendance, and teacher references. 
Co-op provides students with a competitive edge in 
terms of post secondary applications and employment. 
The work experiences, combined with the CLC 12 
curriculum prepare students for post-secondary and 
career decisions</p>

	<h2>Elgin’s Co-op includes Language Arts 11, Law 12, Work 
Experience 12 A & B and Career Life Connections 12

	<h2>Other Information</h2>
	<p>1. Students earn credits in the co-op semester. 
2. Students receive a separate grade for each course.
3. Students complete two work experiences in the coop semester. 
4. Students do not miss any instructional time from 
classes while on work experience, however, due to 
the fact that students will be absent from the 
classroom, and receiving “on the job training” 
during the work experience portion of the co-op 
program, the remaining curricular areas will be 
faster paced during the time the students are in 
school.
5. Due to the pace of the curricular areas and the 
agreements made with employers, it is crucial that 
students maintain an excellent attendance record 
during the co-op semester. 
6. Holidays and/or other absences, other than on 
prescribed school holidays, are strongly 
discouraged during the co-op semester.
7. Students interested in applying for the Co-op 
Programs must submit an application for 
consideration for admission.</p>
