    <p>(Recommended Prerequisite: Drafting 11)</p><hr style="display: none"><p>
        This Computer Aided Drafting and Design course builds on the
        skills and fundamentals taught in TED 10 or DDF 11. Three
        dimensional models and animations are created using AutoCAD,
        Master Cam and Revit. Students will have access to multiple
        technologies including vinyl cutters, soldering irons, hot wire
        cutters, laser engravers and 3D printers. This course will look at
        mechanical and architectural drawing and design using a
        combination of manual and computer drafting. While CAD will
        be primarily used, sketching and hand drawing will allow the
        students to develop their skills around drafting conventions
        such as lettering, dimensioning and view projection. Through a
        series of teacher and student designed projects, students will
        gain an appreciation for drafting and the asset that it can be in
        life, school, and career options.</p>
