  <h2>Calculus 12</h2>
  <p>(Pre-Calculus 12 with B average recommended) This is an excellent preparatory course for first year University Mathematics. The course content is mostly differentiation with applications and introduction of basic integration. (Students registered in CALC 12 may write the UBC/SFU/UNBC/UVIC Challenge Exam in the first week of June.) A percentage with a letter grade is mailed directly to the studentâ€™s home address. The student may then present this credit to local institutions within British Columbia to receive their first year Calculus credit. </p>
  
  
	<hr>
  <h2>Advanced Placement Calculus</h2>
  <p>This is an excellent preparatory course for first and second year university Mathematics. The AP course content is differentiation and integration with applications of the two. Students registered in AP CALC 12 are encouraged to write the AP (Advanced Placement) Exam in May. This course is offered as a linear program with Pre-Calculus Math 12. Students are required to take both Pre-Calculus Math 12 and AP Calculus 12 in this program. It is stressed that students verify prerequisite math courses and grades to specific programs at post-secondary institutions.</p>
