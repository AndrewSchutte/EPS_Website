	<h1>Media Arts</h1>
	<h2>Overview:</h2>
  <p id="p">Media Arts (Film) & Photography courses provide students with a guided process that improves photography, film making, digital art and problem based
learning skills. The general requirements for each
assignment are to do research, concept development,
draft development, final copy-editing and self-critiquing.
There are also many opportunities for self-exploration,
experimentation, contract projects and exhibiting your
pieces in the school and community. Student success
depends on personal maturity – a willingness to do
“prescribed” learning tasks in a methodical and timely
manner.</p>
	<h2>Contents:</h2>
    <li>Film 9/10, 11, 12</li>
    <li>Photography 9/10, 11, 12</li>
	<h2>Projects:</h2>
  <p>To facilitate “real” learning, students are provided with
clear steps and expectations to carry out their projects
(four in number), as well as reasonable timelines –
typically, four weeks. The assignment expectations are
reviewed many times during the month. As well, outside
of class-time is available to clarify comprehension related
questions. Additionally, students will complete weekly
skill building tutorials and in class assignments.</p>
